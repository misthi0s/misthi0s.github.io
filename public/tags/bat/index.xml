      <description>&lt;p&gt;While perusing public samples from the Triage database, I stumbled across an interesting payload that was labelled as AsyncRAT. AsyncRAT is an open-source Remote Access Tool (or Trojan may be more apt) written in C#, so I was curious as to what the infection process would look like starting as a Windows Batch file. For anyone who wants to follow along, the sample on Triage can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://tria.ge/230131-vwe3wahc28/behavioral2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreffer &#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
