    <description><![CDATA[Impacket is an open-source collection of Python libraries that can be used to construct and manipulate network protocols. At its core, it provides low-level programmatic access to packets and, in some cases, complete protocol implementations. The GitHub repository for Impacket can be found here.
Within the repository, Impacket contains a number of example scripts on how its modules can be utilized. These scripts show just how powerful Impacket can be in an offensive context; there are example scripts that allow for such things as performing a Kerberoasting or DCSync attack, relaying NTLM credentials, and generating Kerberos tickets.]]></description>
