    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this installment of &ldquo;Golang Quick Tips &amp; Tricks&rdquo;, we&rsquo;ll go over how to compile your Go project as a Dynamic Link Library, or DLL for short. DLLs are binary files that contain functions and data that can be used by other programs. For instance, if you are making a program that needs to launch a different process, you will likely need to call the function &ldquo;CreateProcess&rdquo; within the &ldquo;kernel32.dll&rdquo; library file to do this. Creating a DLL allows you to easily re-purpose common functions that your different programs need to use without having to re-write it in every single program that needs it.</p>]]></description>
