    <description><![CDATA[Reflective DLL injection is a common technique used by malware that allows an attacker to inject a DLL into a running process without first having to write that DLL to disk. Keeping the DLL binary in memory as opposed to writing to disk provides a few different advantages, particularly in the case of security tools. Files written to disk are commonly scanned by anti-malware tools on creation as well as loading, making malicious DLLs more likely to be discovered and quarantined if created on the system.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[While perusing public samples from the Triage database, I stumbled across an interesting payload that was labelled as AsyncRAT. AsyncRAT is an open-source Remote Access Tool (or Trojan may be more apt) written in C#, so I was curious as to what the infection process would look like starting as a Windows Batch file. For anyone who wants to follow along, the sample on Triage can be found here.
Initial Payload Upon first investigation, the batch file appears to be heavily obfuscated, but upon closer inspection, the behavior exhibited isn&rsquo;t too difficult to interpret.]]></description>
