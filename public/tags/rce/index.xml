    <description><![CDATA[<p>Impacket is an open-source collection of Python libraries that can be used to construct and manipulate network protocols. At its core, it provides low-level programmatic access to packets and, in some cases, complete protocol implementations. The GitHub repository for Impacket can be found <a href="https://github.com/fortra/impacket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">here</a>.</p>
<p>Within the repository, Impacket contains a number of example scripts on how its modules can be utilized. These scripts show just how powerful Impacket can be in an offensive context; there are example scripts that allow for such things as performing a <a href="https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Kerberoasting</a> or <a href="https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">DCSync</a> attack, <a href="https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">relaying NTLM credentials</a>, and generating <a href="https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/getTGT.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer ">Kerberos tickets</a>. It also includes scripts to remotely execute commands on a system via a number of different protocols.</p>]]></description>
