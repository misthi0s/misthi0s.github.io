title: "About Me"
---

Hey there, I'm misthi0s! I'm an information security specialist that has been in the field for around 10 years now, covering a wide swath of roles including security engineering, risk analysis, adversarial simulation, and threat hunting. I'm currently a Threat Researcher, encompassing both threat hunting and detection engineering. In my spare time, I like to reverse engineer malware and write tools in Golang and Python.

My goal with this blog is to both provide a creative outlet for myself where I can post my thoughts and ideas, as well as (hopefully) provide useful insight to others. If I can provide inspiration or knowledge to even a single person, then I have accomplished my mission!
